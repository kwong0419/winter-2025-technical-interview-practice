# Lesson: Test-Driven Development and Simplest Valid Case Approach

## Warm-up Written Question (15 minutes)

Imagine you are asked to build a frying pan. What kind of requirements would you want to include? How would make sure that the pan meets the requirements?

I would want to include the following requirements:

- The pan should be made of high-quality materials
- The pan should be able to withstand high temperatures
- The pan should be able to be used on a variety of surfaces
- The pan should be able to be used for a variety of purposes

I would make sure that the pan meets the requirements by doing trials of tests and making sure each requirement is met.

### What is TDD?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. The process follows three steps:

1. Red: Write a failing test

```javascript
// Failing test for sum function
test('sum function should return the correct sum of two numbers', () => {
  const result = sum(2, 3)
  expect(result).toBe(5)
})
```

2. Green: Write the minimal code to make the test pass
3. Refactor: Improve the code while keeping tests green

### The Simplest Valid Case Approach

- Start with the most basic, valid input
- Gradually add complexity
- Handle edge cases last

### Benefits of TDD

1. Clearer requirements
2. Better code design
3. Confidence in changes
4. Built-in documentation
5. Fewer bugs

### Example: Writing a Squaring Function

### Explain the importance of TDD in relation to DSA and tech interviews

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is highly relevant to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and tech interviews. By following TDD principles, developers can ensure that their code is correct, efficient, and reliable. TDD helps in understanding the problem requirements clearly, designing modular and testable code, and gaining confidence in making changes without introducing bugs. Additionally, TDD provides built-in documentation for the code, making it easier for others to understand and maintain. In DSA and tech interviews, TDD demonstrates a disciplined approach to problem-solving and showcases the ability to write clean and robust code. It also helps in identifying edge cases and handling them effectively. Overall, TDD is an essential skill for developers preparing for DSA and tech interviews.
