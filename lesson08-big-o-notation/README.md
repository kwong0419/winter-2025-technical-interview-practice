### Warm-up (10 minutes)

### Written Question (5 minutes)

**Question:** Why do you think it's important to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm? Provide one example where inefficient code could cause real-world problems.

(Allow students to write a brief response. This question helps set the stage for why big O notation is critical in computer science and software engineering.)

It is important to analyze the efficiency of an algorithm because it helps us understand how well an algorithm performs under different conditions. For example, if we are searching for a number in an array, we can use a linear search to find the number. This is a simple algorithm that has a time complexity of O(n). However, if we are searching for a number in a sorted array, we can use a binary search to find the number. This is a more complex algorithm that has a time complexity of O(log n). In this case, the binary search is more efficient because it reduces the number of operations needed to find the number.

### Lecture Content (20 minutes)

1. **Definition and Importance**

   - Define big O notation as a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity, often used to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
   - Explain why it's crucial for understanding the scalability and efficiency of algorithms, especially in resource-limited applications or large-scale data processing.

2. **Common Big O Notations**

   - Discuss the most common big O complexities: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n), and O(n!).
   - Show simple algorithm examples for each complexity: constant time, linear time, quadratic time

3. **Visualizing Big O**

   - Use graphical representations to compare how different functions grow. Graph the number of operations versus the size of the input for various complexities.

4. **Best, Worst, and Average Cases**
   - Describe how algorithms can have different complexities depending on the input and how big O focuses on the worst-case scenario to ensure algorithm robustness.
